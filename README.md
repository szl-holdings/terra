## What it does

Terra is the real estate intelligence domain pack for the SZL Holdings platform. It monitors New York City public records for distress signals, maps ownership entity relationships, runs AI-assisted lead scoring, and tracks deal pipelines — all under the same governance infrastructure that powers every SZL Holdings product.

Live data: NYC Open Data distress pipeline, Census ACS, BLS, FEMA, SEC EDGAR. Note: maps are blank without a Mapbox token configured.

## Run locally

```bash
# From the monorepo root
pnpm install
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server dev   # Start the API server first
pnpm --filter @workspace/terra dev
```

**Primary route:** `/terra/`

> **Maps:** Add `MAPBOX_TOKEN` to your environment secrets to enable map views. The free Mapbox tier covers all demo use cases.

## Key modules

| Ownership Graph | `/terra/ownership` | Entity relationship mapping for properties |

## About this repository

This is a public showcase of one product in the [SZL Holdings platform](https://github.com/szl-holdings/szl-holdings-platform) monorepo. It mirrors the README from the platform artifact directory; the canonical, version-controlled source — including the React app, tests, and infrastructure — lives in the platform repo.

All seven products share the same operational substrate:

- **[`@workspace/ouroboros`](https://github.com/szl-holdings/ouroboros)** — bounded loops with measurable convergence; proof-route resolver, risk-tier escalation gate, and almanac cycle advancer.
- **[`@workspace/codex-kernel`](https://github.com/szl-holdings/szl-holdings-platform/tree/main/packages/codex-kernel)** — decision receipts, validators, replay, and trace-hash verification.
- **The Ouroboros Thesis v2** — [`szl-holdings/ouroboros-thesis`](https://github.com/szl-holdings/ouroboros-thesis) — the architectural rationale.
